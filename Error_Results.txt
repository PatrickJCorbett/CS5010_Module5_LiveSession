Part 4:

We're going to be looking at COVID data so we'll need to perform the following tests on our code:
--Make sure our code detects and handles empty/NULL values in the data set
--Make sure that if we use a counter to increment something that it counts correctly, like patient deaths or counts of symptoms reported, etc.
--Make sure that whatever class we build to deal with the data (maybe a Patient class) constructs the object correctly even when fields are blank or not passed into the constructor
